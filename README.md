This notebook uses agent-based modeling to simulate slash-and-burn agriculture in São Paulo, Brazil, from the late 16th to the 18th centuries. Slash-and-burn agriculture -- also known as itinerant, shifting, swidden, or (in Brazil) *coivara* and *roça de toco* -- is a method of farming in which farmers burn tracts of forest to clear and fertilize the terrain. Because the fertility of the soil lasts only a few seasons, farmers have to move periodically in search of new areas with lush vegetation, creating a cycle of mobility and deforestation. This simulation serves to examine the adoption of slash-and-burn techniques by Portuguese colonists, assessing the scale of environmental impact produced by the colonization and the patterns of geographic mobility created by this technique.
